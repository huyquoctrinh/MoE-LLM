He named it protein C because it was the third protein (\"peak C\") that eluted from a DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange chromotograph. Seegers was, at the time, searching for vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors undetected by clotting assays, which measure global clotting function. Soon after this, Seegers recognised Stenflo\\'s discovery was identical with his own. : 6822 Activated protein C was discovered later that year,  and in 1977 it was first recognised that APC inactivates Factor V a. : 2382  In 1980, Vehar and Davie discovered that APC also inactivates Factor VIII a,  and soon after, Protein S was recognised as a cofactor by Walker.  In 1982, a family study by Griffin et al. first associated protein C deficiency with symptoms of venous thrombosis.  Homozygous protein C deficiency and the consequent serious health effects were described in 1984 by several scientists. : 1214 cDNA cloning of protein C was first performed in 1984 by Beckmann et al. which produced a map of the gene responsible for producing protein C in the liver.  In 1987 a seminal experiment was performed (Taylor et al.) whereby it was demonstrated that activated protein C prevented coagulopathy and death in baboons infused with lethal concentrations of E. coli. : 2382 \\nIn 1993, a heritable resistance to APC was detected by Dahlbäck et al. and associated with familial thrombophilia.  In 1994, the relatively common genetic mutation that produces Factor V Leiden was noted (Bertina et al.).  Two years later, Gla-domainless APC was imaged at a resolution of 2.8 Ångströms. α›  Beginning with the PROWESS clinical trial of 2001,  it was recognised that many of the symptoms of sepsis may be ameliorated by infusion of APC, and mortality rates of septic patients may be significantly decreased. : 3161,6 Near the end of that year, Drotrecogin alfa (activated), a recombinant human activated protein C, became the first drug approved by the U.S. FDA for treating severe sepsis.

Since then, the number of cases reported has fluctuated, but still appearing to decline overall. \\nChancroid may develop in individuals of any age but is typically found in sexually active individuals with a mean patient age of 30 years.\\nThe male-to-female ratio of patients with chancroid ranges from 3:1 in endemic areas to 25:1 during outbreak situations.  Female sex workers with either symptomatic chancroid or as asymptomatic carriers serve as a reservoir for H. ducreyi. \\nAlthough race is not a risk factor, chancroid is seen more commonly in African Americans and Hispanics in the United States. \\nChancroid is uncommon in the United States and other developed countries, but can been present in endemic areas associated with the use of crack cocaine and prostitution. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 6 cases of chancroid in 2014.  The majority of cases in developed countries occur in individuals who have returned from chancroid-endemic areas in the world.\\nChancroid is a major cause of genital ulcer disease in Africa, southeast Asia and parts of Latin America.  Acquiring epidemiological data is more difficult in developing countries due to greater lack of resources to test for H. ducreyi. Chancroid is common in countries that have high rates of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, because HIV facilitates acquisition of H. ducreyi and vice versa.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': '\"What is childhood disintegrative disorder, and what information is associated with it?\"', 'output': 'The health care provider will determine whether the child has this disorder, or a similar condition such as childhood schizophrenia or pervasive developmental disorder (autism).\\nThe most important sign of childhood disintegrative disorder is the loss of developmental milestones.

These include the glucocorticoids which are critical for regulation of blood sugar and the immune system, as well as response to physiological stress, the mineralcorticoid aldosterone, which regulates blood pressure and kidney function, and certain sex hormones. Both benign and malignant tumors of the adrenal cortex may produce steroid hormones, with important clinical consequences.\\nAdrenocortical adenomas, or adrenocortical \"nodules\", are small, benign tumors of the adrenal cortex which are extremely common (present in 1-10% of persons at autopsy). The clinical significance of these neoplasms is twofold. First, they have been detected as incidental findings with increasing frequency in recent years, due to the increasing use of CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging in a variety of medical settings. This can result in expensive additional testing and invasive procedures to rule out the slight possibility of an early adrenocortical carcinoma. Second, a minority of adrenocortical adenomas are \"functional\", meaning that they produce glucocorticoids, mineralcorticoids, and/or sex steroids, resulting in endocrine disorders such as Cushing\\'s syndrome, Conn\\'s syndrome (hyperaldosteronism), virilization of females, or feminization of males. Functional adrenocortical adenomas are surgically curable.\\nMain article: Adrenocortical carcinoma\\nAdrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, highly aggressive cancer of adrenal cortical cells, which may occur in children or adults. ACC\\'s may be \"functional\", producing steroid hormones and consequent endocrine dysfunction similar to that seen in many adrenocortical adenomas, but many are not. Due to their location deep in the retroperitoneum, most adrenocortical carcinomas are not diagnosed until they have grown quite large. They frequently invade large vessels, such as the renal vein and inferior vena cava, as well as metastasizing via the lymphatics and through the blood to the lungs and other organs. The most effective treatment is surgery, although this is not feasible for many patients, and the overall prognosis of the disease is poor. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy may also be employed in the treatment of this disease.\\nThe adrenal medulla is located anatomically at the center of each adrenal gland, and is composed of neuroendocrine (chromaffin) cells which produce and release epinephrine (adrenaline) into the bloodstream in response to activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma are the two most important tumors which arise from the adrenal medulla. Both tumors may also arise from extra-adrenal sites, specifically, in the paraganglia of the sympathetic chain.\\nMain article: Neuroblastoma\\nNeuroblastoma is an aggressive cancer of immature neuroblastic cells (precursors of neurons), and is one of the most common pediatric cancers, with a median age at diagnosis of two years. Adrenal neuroblastoma typically presents with a rapidly enlarging abdominal mass. Although the tumor has often spread to distant parts of the body at the time of diagnosis, this cancer is unusual in that many cases are highly curable when the spread is limited to the liver, skin, and/or bone marrow (stage IVS). Related, but less aggressive tumors composed of more mature neural cells include ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma. Neuroblastic tumors often produce elevated levels of catecholamine hormone precursors, such as vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid, and may produce severe watery diarrhea through production of vasoactive intestinal peptide. Treatment of neuroblastoma includes surgery and radiation therapy for localized disease, and chemotherapy for metastatic disease.\\nMain article: Pheochromocytoma\\nPheochromocytoma is a neoplasm composed of cells similar to the chromaffin cells of the mature adrenal medulla. Pheochromocytomas occur in patients of all ages, and may be sporadic, or associated with a hereditary cancer syndrome, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types IIA and IIB, neurofibromatosis type I, or von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Only 10% of adrenal pheochromocytomas are malignant, while the rest are benign tumors. The most clinically important feature of pheochromocytomas is their tendency to produce large amounts of the catecholamine hormones epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. This may lead to potentially life-threatening high blood pressure, or cardiac arrythmias, and numerous symptoms such as headache, palpitations, anxiety attacks, sweating, weight loss, and tremor. Diagnosis is most easily confirmed through urinary measurement of catecholamine metabolites such as VMA and metanephrines. Most pheochromocytomas are initially treated with anti-adrenergic drugs to protect against catecholamine overload, with surgery employed to remove the tumor once the patient is medically stable.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What causes glomerulosclerosis?', 'output': 'The cause of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is usually unknown.\\nKnown causes include:\\nHeroin use HIV Inherited genetic problems Obesity Reflux nephropathy (a condition in which urine flows backward from the bladder to the kidney) Sickle cell disease'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What are the additional diagnostic tests for lung cancer?', 'output': 'Bone scan may demonstrate bone metastases.\\nFDG (18 F fluoro-deoxyglucose) PET scans along with contrast enhanced CT may be helpful in the evaluation of the extent of lung cancer.

Teenagers in particular occasionally rebel against the dietary strictures and suffer relapses or complications as a result. The widespread use of wheat byproducts in prepared food, soups and sauces can make dining out problematic. This is especially true in the United States, where dermatitis herpetiformis disease is less widely-known among the wider population than it is in Europe. However, certain types of restaurants (e.g., Japanese, Thai, Indian, and Latin American) already offer a wide range of gluten-free menu options, and many major restaurant chains have responded to growing awareness of celiac disease (and by default dermatitis herpetiformis) by posting information about the gluten content of their menu items on their websites.\\nIt is important for friends and family to understand that dermatitis herpetiformis is present for life.\\nAs celiac disease has become better understood, the availability of gluten-free replacements for everyday treats such as muffins, bagels, pasta and the like has continually improved, as has their quality. This has also benefited those with dermatitis herpetiformis. People with dermatitis herpetiformis and/or celiac cannot eat only gluten-free foods but continue to consume one or two products that contain gluten. For example, drinking beer can still cause symptoms, but even this problem may now be overcome. There are many specialty brews around the world that may be described as gluten free beer.\\nHowever, the case of beer raises the main problem of dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease: while the diet is strict and the effects of the disease are serious, the main symptom of the disease can be social isolation with those with dermatitis herpetiformis afraid to become involved in normal social life. Parties can be difficult, weddings and funerals hard, holidays awkward, a meal out a nightmare, travel is made more stressful, and even the trip to a bar or pub one that requires the individual to be constantly aware of the disease. It is too easy for the celiacs and those with dermatitis herpetiformis to withdraw from these normal activities, and many people with these complaints are working to create normal activities where they can forget the problem. It is important for newly diagnosed with either dermatitis herpetiformis or celiacs to ensure that they remain involved in their social life and explain their needs to family and friends.\\nAlthough these diseases may tend to isolate individuals with the complaint, the situation is becoming less difficult year by year. Manufacturers are now making a wide range of very acceptable breads, and some pastas (notoriously horrible in the past) that are virtually indistinguishable from \"normal\" pasta. Restaurants are beginning to offer gluten free menus and are recognizing the size of the market that is largely not catered for. Celiacs and those with dermatitis herpetiformis should not be afraid to ask establishments how they can cater to them. Where the question has been asked repeatedly, the proprietors tend to recognize the need, and become aware of the revenue that is lost where they do not provide a full range of products.\\nIn many ways beer seems to be the hardest gluten free product to \"get right\". However, gluten-free beer is now available and there is now a range of ales, beers, and lagers to choose from. Around the world standards of \"gluten free\" vary. For example, while in the United Kingdom a beer with less than 20 parts per million gluten (20ppm) is \"gluten free\", in Australia it is not possible to describe any product as such if any gluten can be detected at all. Similarly, some \"gluten free\" breads can contain low levels of gluten in one country, in another they would contravene labeling or food standards legislation.\\nHowever, large scale commercial beers are out of the question for those who cannot consume gluten,    regardless of the sometimes misleading advice on some brewery websites. It is likely that most people with dermatitis herpetiformis celiacs will be able to drink beer at under 20ppm (in moderation) without causing themselves any harm. It is important, however, for consumers of all \"low gluten\" foods and beverages to tell their consultant, and to ensure that even if the obvious symptoms are absent, there are no other negative effects continuing that they are unaware of.\\nHowever, the development of a range of gluten free beers is an example of those who cannot consume gluten \"working together to socialize normally and avoid isolation caused by their special dietary needs. It also represents part of the return to a ‘normal’ life.\"'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is the relationship between Adrenergic and myocarditis?', 'output': 'Surgical resection of the tumor is the ultimate treatment to remove excess catecholamines from the body.

The recommended practice which is followed currently is to acquire a tissue biopsy sample, with the exception of patients who have a characteristic elevation in tumor markers and in whom surgical intervention may lead to significant complications. Partial and gross total surgical resection of germinomas has no proven benefit and may lead to endocrinological and neurological deterioration. Therefore, in these patients surgical intervention is limited to biopsy and these patients are treated with radiation and chemotherapy. Since patients with choriocarcinoma have an increased tendency to hemorrhage, these patients are treated with early and radical surgery. Since patients with NGGCTs have poor long-term survival, therefore surgery for these patients is aimed at improving outcome. When removal of all tumor tissue is not possible in these patients reduction of tumor burden by partial resection is often an option available. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy are often incorporated in the treatment plan. There are no definitive data that suggest that gross total resection of NGGCT at the time of diagnosis improves either an overall survival or a progression-free survival. However, resection of residual tumors after radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may have a role, with a few small studies suggesting that gross total resection may improve survival. In patients with small surgical samples that may not be representative, such as histological diagnosis of pure germinoma and raised alpha-fetoprotein should be treated more aggressively than those with pure germinoma with normal CSF / serum markers. Patients with a tissue diagnosis of nongerminomatous germ cell tumors NGGCT should be treated as such regardless of serum/CSF tumor markers. Patients who presents with obstructive hydrocephalus may require a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Surgery may be performed to remove the residual tissue and permit its histological verification in patients who have had an incomplete response to initial chemotherapy. The residual tissue may contain malignant components; however, it may consist of necrosis, fibrosis, or a mature teratoma—the so-called growing teratoma syndrome. The growing teratoma syndrome is characterized by a solitary enlarging tumor mass during or after chemotherapy, with normal or declining AFP and/or beta-HCG.

Commonly, a person is first exposed to the virus during or after adolescence.\\nOnce the acute symptoms of an initial infection disappear, they often do not return. But once infected, the patient carries the virus for the rest of their life. The virus typically lives dormantly in B lymphocytes. Independent infections of mononucleosis may be contracted multiple times, regardless of whether the patient is already carrying the virus dormantly.\\nPeriodically, the virus can reactivate, during which time the patient is again infectious, but usually without any symptoms of illness. Usually, a patient has few, if any, further symptoms or problems from the latent B lymphocyte infection. However, in susceptible hosts under the appropriate environmental stressors, reactivation of the virus is observed and known to cause vague subclinical symptoms or remain mostly asymptomatic and is diagnosed by positive serologic response. Additionally, its imperative to note that during this phase the virus can spread to others.\\nSimilar such reactivation or chronic sub-clinical viral activity in susceptible hosts may trigger multiple host autoimmune diseases and cancers secondary to EBV's predilection to B lymphocytes (the primary antibody-producing cell of the immune system) and its ability to alter both lymphocyte proliferation and lymphocyte antibody production.  \\nBurkitt's lymphoma is a type of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and is most common in the equatorial Africa. It is co-existent with the presence of malaria. Malarial infection is shown to reduce the immune surveillance of EBV immortalized B cells; thereby, allowing their proliferation which in turn increases the chance of a mutation to occur. Repeated such mutations lead to the escape of B cells from cell-cycle control and furthermore allow the cells to proliferate unchecked, resulting in the formation of Burkitt's lymphoma. Commonly affects the jaw bone, forming a huge tumor mass. Responds quickly to chemotherapy treatment, namely cyclophosphamide, but recurrence is common.\\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma is a cancer found in the upper respiratory tract, most commonly in the nasopharynx, and is linked to the EBV virus. Occurs secondary to both genetic and environmental factors Predominantly prevalent in Southern China and Africa. It is much more common in people of Chinese ancestry (genetic), but is also linked to the Chinese diet of a high amount of smoked fish, which contain nitrosamines, well known carcinogens (environmental). \\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, EBV became the favored explanation for chronic fatigue syndrome. It was noted that people with chronic exhaustion had EBV, although it was also noted EBV was present in almost everyone.\\nIn a four year study, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the virus did not adhere to Koch's Postulates and therefore had no definitive association between CFS and EBV but it is still being studied by researchers.\\nMajority of the chronic post-infectious fatigue state appear not to be caused by a chronic viral infection, but be triggered by the acute infection.\\nDirect and indirect evidence of persistent viral infection has been found in CFS, for example in muscle and via detection of an unusually low molecular weight RNase L enzyme, although the commonality and significance of such findings is disputed. Hickie et al, contend that mononucleosis appears to cause a hit and run injury to the brain in the early stages of the acute phase, thereby causing the chronic fatigue state. This would explain why in mononucleosis, fatigue very often lingers for months after the Epstein Barr Virus has been controlled by the immune system. However, it has also been noted in several (although altogether rare) cases that the only symptom displayed by a mononucleosis sufferer is elevated moods and higher energy levels, virtually the opposite of CFS and comparable to hypomania.\\nJust how infectious mononucleosis changes the brain and causes fatigue (or lack thereof) in certain individuals remains to be seen. Such a mechanism may include activation of microglia in the brain of some individuals during the acute infection, thereby causing a slowly dissipating fatigue.\"}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is information about adjustment disorder?', 'output': 'Adjustment disorder is an emotional and behavioral reaction that develops within 3 months of a life stress, and which is stronger or greater than what would be expected for the type of event that occurred.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is the main method of preventing Chagas disease?', 'output': 'Methods of primary prevention of Chagas disease include use of insecticides to control the vector, use of new construction compounds in building walls and roofs, and organ/blood testing prior to donation.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What are the pharmacodynamic characteristics of Moxonidine?', 'output': 'Effects on insulin resistance\\nIn all animal models of insulin resistance, moxonidine had striking effects on the development of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and impaired glucose homeostasis.

According to the affected lid structure and the location of the predominant inflammation, marginal blepharitis can be divided into:    \\nAnterior blepharitis\\nAnterior blepharitis describes an inflammation of the lid margin anterior to the gray line and concentrated around the lashes. It may be accompanied by squamous debris or collarettes around the lashes, and inflammation may spill onto the posterior lid margin.\\nPosterior blepharitis\\nPosterior blepharitis describes an inflammation of the posterior lid margin, which may have different causes, including meibomian gland dysfunction, conjunctival inflammation (allergic or infective), and/or other conditions, such as acne rosacea.\\nBlepharitis can also be classified as acute or chronic, depending on the acuity of onset and time course of clinical presentation: \\nAcute blepharitis\\nAcute ulcerative blepharitis Acute ulcerative blepharitis is typically caused by staphylococcal infection. It may also be caused by herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus.

The life cycles of all five human schistosomes are broadly similar.  \\nSchistosomal eggs are released into the environment from infected individuals. The schistosomal eggs hatch on contact with fresh water to release the free-swimming miracidium. Miracidia infect fresh-water snails by penetrating the snail's foot. After infection, the miracidium transforms into a primary sporocyst. Germ cells within the primary sporocyst will then begin dividing to produce secondary sporocysts, which migrate to the snail's hepatopancreas. Once at the hepatopancreas, germ cells within the secondary sporocyst begin to divide producing thousands of new parasites, known as cercariae, which are the larvae capable of infecting mammals. Cercariae emerge daily from the snail host in a circadian rhythm, dependent on ambient temperature and light. Young cercariae are highly motile, alternating between vigorous upward movement and sinking to maintain their position in the water. Cercarial activity is particularly stimulated by water turbulence, by shadows and by chemicals found on human skin.\\nPenetration of the human skin occurs after the cercaria have attached to and explored the skin. The parasite secretes enzymes that break down the skin's protein to enable penetration of the cercarial head through the skin. As the cercaria penetrates the skin it transforms into a migrating schistosomulum stage. The newly transformed schistosomulum may remain inside the skin for 2 days before locating a post-capillary venule. The schistosomulum travels from the skin to the lungs where it undergoes further developmental changes necessary for subsequent migration to the liver. Eight to ten days after penetration of the skin, the parasite migrates to the liver sinusoids. The nearly-mature worms pair, with the longer female worm residing in the gynaecophoric channel of the male. S. haematobium schistosomula ultimately migrates from the liver to the perivesical venous plexus of the bladder, ureters, and kidneys through the hemorrhoidal plexus. Parasites reach maturity in six to eight weeks, at which time they begin to produce eggs. S. haematobium eggs pass through the ureteral or bladder wall and into the urine. Only mature eggs are capable of crossing into the digestive tract, possibly through the release of proteolytic enzymes, but also as a function of host immune response, which fosters local tissue ulceration. Up to half the eggs released by the worm pairs become trapped in the mesenteric veins, or will be washed back into the liver, where they will become lodged. Trapped eggs mature normally, secreting antigens that elicit a vigorous immune response. The eggs themselves do not damage the body rather it is the cellular infiltration resultant from the immune response that causes the pathology classically associated with schistosomiasis.\\nInfection can occur by:\\nPenetration of the human skin by cercaria Handling of contaminated soil Consumption of contaminated water or food sources (e.g, unwashed garden vegetables)\\nCercaria gets transformed into migrating schistosomulum stage in the skin. Migrating schistosomulum are transported via the blood stream to respective organ system.\\nThe incubation period for acute schistosomiasis is usually 14-84 days.\\nCercaria are the infective stage of schistosomiasis to humans.\\nMiracidium is diagnostic for schistosomiasis.\\nThe pathogenesis of acute human schistosomiasis is related to egg deposition and liberation of antigens of adult worms and eggs.  A strong inflammatory response characterized by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins 1 and 6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and by circulating immune complexes participates in the pathogenesis of the acute phase of the disease.\\nBoth the early and late manifestations of schistosomiasis are immunologically mediated.   The major pathology of infection occurs with chronic schistosomiasis. Eggs may be trapped at sites of deposition (urinary bladde r, ureters, intestine) or be carried by the bloodstream t o other organs, most commonly the liver and less often the lungs and central nervous system. The host response to these eggs involves local as well as systemic manifestations. The cell-mediated immune response leads to granulomas composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils that surround the trapped eggs and add significantly to the degree of tissue destruction. Granuloma formation in the bladder wall and at the ureterovesical junction results in the major disease manifestations of schistosomiasis haematobia (hematuria, dysuria, and obstructive uropathy). Intestinal, as well as hepatic granulomas, underlie the pathologic sequelae of the other schistosome infections(ulcerations and fibrosis of intestinal wall, hepatosplenomegaly, and portal hypertension) due to pre-sinusoidal obstruction of blood flow. Anti-schistosome inflammation increases circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines. These responses are associated with hepcidin -mediated inhibition of iron uptake and use, leading to anemia of chronic inflammation. Schistosomiasis-related undernutrition may be the result of similar pathways of chronic inflammation. Acquired partial protective immunity against schistosomiasis has been demonstrated in some animal species and may occur in humans.\"}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is the management of myopia?', 'output': 'Practitioners and advocates of alternative therapies often recommend eye exercises and relaxation techniques such as the Bates method.

This entity accounts for 7% of children and 12% of adults with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. MPGN causes significant proportion of the cases of nephritis among patients in nonindustrialized countries. For example, in Mexico, MPGN accounts for 40% of all patients with nephritis. Most of these patients have type I disease; MPGN type II is uncommon. However, the incidence of MPGN type I is decreasing progressively in developed countries, which may be explained by a change in environmental factors, especially a decline in infections. In an investigation of the changing patterns of adult primary glomerular disease occurrence in a single region of the United Kingdom, Hanko analyzed the results of 1844 native renal biopsies taken between 1976 and 2005 (inclusive) and found the presence of primary glomerulonephritis was revealed in 49% of the biopsies, with the most common forms being immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (38.8%). Other common forms were membranous nephropathy (29.4%), minimal-change disease (MCD) (9.8%), MPGN type 1 (9.6%), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (5.7%). The incidence of IgA nephropathy increased significantly over the study period, whereas the occurrence of membranous nephropathy decreased. In the United States, MPGN predominantly affects the white population. Type I disease affects women more often than men, whereas a nearly equal sex distribution is seen in MPGN type II. The idiopathic forms of MPGN are more common in children and young adults (range, 6-30 y). Isolated reports of involvement in patients as young as 2 years and as old as 80 years are noted in the literature. Secondary types of MPGN predominate among adults. By dividing glomerular diseases into two subtypes, which are Nephrotic or Nephritic, subdividing into several specific disease will be much more easier  .The incidence of MPGN (as a lesion in renal biopsies) ranges from 1.4 to 9.3 cases per million population  (pmp) per year and with few exceptions, the incidence has decreased over time.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What classification does Toxoplasmosis belong to?', 'output': 'Acute: If the duration of symptoms is less than 4-6 weeks Chronic: If the symptoms persist for more than 6 weeks.\\nNeurotoxoplasmosis (cerebral toxoplasmosis) Pulmonary toxoplasmosis Occular toxoplasmosis Congenital toxoplasmosis'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What information does an MRI provide for someone with acute viral nasopharyngitis?', 'output': 'There are no MRI findings associated with acute viral nasopharyngitis.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is meant by blood type?', 'output': \"Transfusion medicine is a specialized branch of hematology that is concerned with the study of blood groups, along with the work of a blood bank to provide a transfusion service for blood and other blood products. Across the world, blood products must be prescribed by a medical doctor (licensed physician or surgeon) in a similar way as medicines. In the USA, blood products are tightly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.\\nMuch of the routine work of a blood bank involves testing blood from both donors and recipients to ensure that every individual recipient is given blood that is compatible and is as safe as possible. If a unit of incompatible blood is transfused between a donor and recipient, a severe acute immunological reaction, hemolysis (RBC destruction), renal failure and shock are likely to occur, and death is a possibility. Antibodies can be highly active and can attack RBCs and bind components of the complement system to cause massive hemolysis of the transfused blood.\\nPatients should ideally receive their own blood or type-specific blood products to minimize the chance of a transfusion reaction. Risks can be further reduced by cross-matching blood, but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's blood with a sample of the donor's blood and checking to see if the mixture agglutinates, or forms clumps. If agglutination is not obvious by direct vision, blood bank technicians usually check for agglutination with a microscope. If agglutination occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient. In a blood bank it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so labeling has been standardized using a barcode system known as ISBT 128.\\nThe blood group may be included on identification tags or on tattoos worn by military personnel, in case they should need an emergency blood transfusion. Frontline German Waffen-SS had such tattoos during World War II. Ironically, this was an easy form of SS identification. \\nRare blood types can cause supply problems for blood banks and hospitals. For example Duffy -negative blood occurs much more frequently in people of African origin,  and the rarity of this blood type in the rest of the population can result in a shortage of Duffy-negative blood for patients of African ethnicity. Similarly for RhD negative people, there is a risk associated with travelling to parts of the world where supplies of RhD negative blood are rare, particularly East Asia, where blood services may endeavor to encourage Westerners to donate blood. \\nA pregnant woman can make IgG blood group antibodies if her fetus has a blood group antigen that she does not have. This can happen if some of the fetus' blood cells pass into the mother's blood circulation (e.g. a small fetomaternal hemorrhage at the time of childbirth or obstetric intervention), or sometimes after a therapeutic blood transfusion. This can cause Rh disease or other forms of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in the current pregnancy and/or subsequent pregnancies. If a pregnant woman is known to have anti-RhD antibodies, the RhD blood type of a fetus can be tested by analysis of fetal DNA in maternal plasma to assess the risk to the fetus of Rh disease.  Antibodies associated with some blood groups can cause severe HDN, others can only cause mild HDN and others are not known to cause HDN.\"}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is the significance of MRI in the diagnosis of dermatomyositis?', 'output': 'Utilizing an MRI for the diagnosis of dermatomyositis is useful because it can detect subtle muscle inflammation and swelling in early stages of the disease.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'Could you give me an overview of Papillorenal syndrome, please?', 'output': 'The renal coloboma syndrome differentials include most of the disease with renal and ocular anomalies.

A person who is diagnosed with anorexia nervosa is most commonly referred to with the adjectival form anorexic. The noun form, as in\\'he is an anorectic\\', is used less commonly. The term \" anorectic \" can also refer to any drug that suppresses appetite.\\n\"Anorexia nervosa\" is frequently shortened to \" anorexia \" in both the popular media and scientific literature. This is technically incorrect, as strictly speaking \"anorexia\" refers to the medical symptom of reduced appetite.\\nIn popular culture, and especially with anorectics themselves, the term is often shortened to \"ana\" to avoid sounding clinical and impersonal. \" Pro-ana \" groups often use the terms \"ana\" and \"mia\" (referring to bulimia nervosa) to describe their conditions, as it has less negative connotations than the full medical term. Some pro-ana groups discourage or deride the use of colloquial abbreviations.\\nThe history of anorexia nervosa begins with the first recognition and description of anorexia as a disease in the late 19th century. It became widely known, particularly in the United States, in the 1980s.\\nIn the late 19th century, the public attention drawn to \" fasting girls \" provoked conflict between religion and science. Such cases as Sarah Jacob (the \"Welsh Fasting Girl\") and Mollie Fancher (the \"Brooklyn Enigma\") stimulated controversy as experts weighed the claims of complete abstinence from food. Believers referenced the duality of mind and body, while skeptics insisted on the laws of science and material facts of life. Critics accused the fasting girls of hysteria, superstition, and deceit. The progress of secularization and medicalization passed cultural authority from clergy to physicians, transforming anorexia nervosa from revered to repulsed.\\nDuring the period when this disease was first named \"anorexia nervosa\", in the early to mid 19th century, as opposed to its original title that assumed it was a type of hysteria, doctors began to emphasize and isolate what procedures and techniques contributed to the most successful recoveries in the young women afflicted. One of the most commonly shared opinions in treatment was the isolation of the patient from family, friends, loved ones, and any social connections which in technical terms is termed as a parentectomy. Theories of the reasons for the development and spread of the disease in Victorian society is rooted in the idea of a close-knit and involved family, and especially mothers in their young privileged daughter\\'s life. Women were expected to behave eloquently and were controlled and under constant supervision. It is hypothesized that this was a daughter\\'s way of controlling her life and of trying to look better in society; having control of what was going into her body was the one aspect in her life she fully dominated. It was documented by many physicians that most often as soon as girls were isolated from their social pressures they made quick and successful recoveries from the diseases. Also it was stated that it was the professional and moral authority of doctors and nurses that forced anoretics to begin eating again, and that they did so out of fear of the doctors.\\nEarly treatment of anorexia nervosa is illustrated in the novel Second Star to the Right by Deborah Hautzig. In the story, an anorexic girl named Leslie is placed in the behavior-modification ward in a hospital. She is required to drink at least of liquid food per day, or else she is involuntarily force fed by hospital wardens. While the story does fall short in depicting the harsh reality of hospitalized anorexic, it does provide an accurate description of one of the first medical procedures against anorexia nervosa - Force feeding. Other forms of early treatment included \"drug therapy, psychoanalysis, dynamic psychotherapy, family therapy, behavior modification, peer counseling and support groups social skills training, assertiveness training, projective art therapy, hypnosis, relaxation techniques, movement therapy,nutritional education, and even sex education.\" Early treatment was usually a combination of a monitored eating program and psychological instruction which aimed to raise the patients awareness of the disorder and also to promote psychological growth. However, treatments varied on the amount of emphasis placed on the eating program or the psychological instruction. Some programs regarded immediate weight gain as the first step in recovery and psychological growth second, while others emphasized the psychological treatment of the patient over the weight gaining program. Forced feeding was reserved for the most dangerous cases of anorexia nervosa, where a patient becomes so emaciated that his/her life may be in jeopardy. A patient undergoing forced feeding would have invasive tubes placed in his/her nose where food would pass into the body, or could undergo a relatively new process called total parenteral nutrition (TNP). TNP is best described as the process where \"an intravenous catheter is inserted so that the tip lies in a large vein near the heart, where blood flow is relatively rapid. Then a concentrated fluid containing a balance of nutrition is infused at a steady rate.\" The cost of these medical procedures is very high, their success or effectiveness is not guaranteed, and the procedures can vary greatly from doctor to doctor, making anorexia nervosa one of the more difficult disorders to treat.\\nAnorexia nervosa is thought to be a new disease by most people of today’s society. This disease, however, is known to have existed since the late 19th century. Today anorexia nervosa is classified as a disease. During the Victorian Era, the disorder was thought to be a form of hysteria that affected mainly women of the middle and upper classes. Obesity during this era was thought to be a characteristic of poverty. In general however, the ideal woman’s body type during the Victorian era was one that was curvy and full- figured. Many women attempted to achieve this body type through the use of corsets. The role of restrictive corsets during the Victorian era shows the early focus on body type and exemplifies how women, as early as the late 18th century, have been taking extreme measures to achieve the believed ideal body type. (Brumberg, \"Fasting Girls\"), (Carol Lawson, \"Anorexia: It\\'s Not a New Disease\")\\nAlthough the medical facts of anorexia nervosa have been documented since the 1870s, personal details of anorexics\\' lives are more publicized today than ever before. Since Karen Carpenter\\'s death in 1983, which resulted from complications of the disorder, people recognize and casually label overly thin women as anorexics. Since the late 1980s, many special eating disorder clinics have opened, but it may be difficult to change the eating behavior and mindset of an anorexia victim, especially when they are surrounded by numerous other thin women who have similar eating behaviors. Today, many young women are obsessed with dieting as a form of cultural expression and a way to look as thin as models and celebrities. Anorexia nervosa seems to be more prevalent as the ideal female body image becomes thinner; however, the disorder may have always been this widespread but just less publicized.\\nIn the 1980s, slimness embodied the ideal of feminine beauty. It is this that caused many women to incessantly diet in order to keep up with the demands of modern fashion. In a 1984 survey carried out by Glamor magazine of thirty-three thousand women between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five, 75 percent believed they were fat, although only 25 percent were actually overweight (Palm Beach Post, December 26, 1985). Indications of being thin was important to women of the upper class, and this class specific cultural model was pervasive throughout the media including television, film, magazines, and advertising After Growing Pains actress Tracey Gold nearly died from severe complications caused by self-starvation, anorexia in children and adolescents became a more serious issue than in adults. Various pediatric organizations now focus on this issue with methods of counseling designed for the under-18 age groups.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What exactly is primary central nervous system lymphoma?', 'output': 'There are no known direct causes for primary central nervous system lymphoma.

The three fatty acids RCOOH, R\\'COOH and R\"COOH can be all different, all the same, or only two the same.\\nChain lengths of the fatty acids in naturally occurring triglycerides can be of varying lengths but 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. Natural fatty acids found in plants and animals are typically composed only of even numbers of carbon atoms due to the way they are bio-synthesised from acetyl CoA. Bacteria, however, possess the ability to synthesise odd- and branched-chain fatty acids. Consequently, ruminant animal fat contains odd numbered fatty acids, such as 15, due to the action of bacteria in the rumen.\\nMost natural fats contain a complex mixture of individual triglycerides; because of this, they melt over a broad range of temperatures. Cocoa butter is unusual in that it is composed of only a few triglycerides, one of which contains palmitic, oleic and stearic acids in that order. This gives rise to a fairly sharp melting point, causing chocolate to melt in the mouth without feeling greasy.\\n\\nGeneral structure of a triglyceride Example of an unsaturated fat triglyceride.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia occurs when tumors are found in at least two endocrine glands. Tumors can also develop in organs and tissues other than endocrine glands. If the tumors become cancerous, some cases can be life-threatening. The disorder affects 1 in 30,000 people.\\nAlthough many different types of hormone-producing tumors are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia, tumors of the parathyroid gland, pituitary gland, and pancreas are most frequent in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tumors cause an overactivation of these hormone-producing glands, leading to serious health problems such as severe ulcers. Overactivity of the parathyroid gland (hyperparathyroidism) is the most common sign of this disorder. Hyperparathyroidism disrupts the normal balance of calcium in the blood, which can lead to kidney stones, thinning of bones, weakness, and fatigue.\\nNeoplasia in the pituitary gland can manifest as prolactinomas whereby too much prolactin is secreted, suppressing the release of gonadotropins, causing a decrease in sex hormones such as testosterone.\\nPancreatic tumors usually form in the islet cells, which over-secrete insulin, causing a decrease in blood glucose levels.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What other imaging findings are typically associated with gallbladder cancer?', 'output': 'Given the rate of high incidence of metastases in gallbladder cancer, FDG(fluorodeoxyglucose), PET (positron emission tomography) scan is particularly useful in identifying metastases.

Mumps virus is a member of the paramyoxoviridae family with a single-strand, negative-sense RNA molecule. The mumps HN and F glycoproteins reach the surface of the infected host cell through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex.  Virions emerge from the infected cells due to the M protein facilitating the localization of the viral ribonucleic proteins onto the host cell membrane.  The virus binds with the neighboring host cells via sialic acid through HN glycoprotein.  Both HN and F glycoproteins mediate the fusion of virus and host cell, as well as cell and cell - membrane fusion, to perpetuate the spread of the virus throughout the host.  The virus replicates in the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes.  Upon replication, viremia occurs for three to five days, spreading to the salivary glands.  The parotid gland particularly susceptible to parotitis due to the lower rate of secretion.  Salivary flow rate is reduced due to the inflammation response. Reduced saliva flow rate in the parotid gland leads to a reduction in the salivary defense proteins IgA (sIgA) and IgG, increasing vulnerability of the parotid gland to infection.  Parotitis results from the inflammatory response to the presence of mumps virus in the parotid salivary gland.\\nBacterial parotitis is most commonly caused by staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive coccal bacterium often found in the respiratory tract.

The most commonly used selective beta-1 blockers are metoprolol, atenolol, and bisoprolol.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is the underlying abnormal physiological condition that causes hepatopulmonary syndrome?', 'output': 'Nitric oxide\\nThe normal physiology of nitric oxide can be understood as follows:\\nThe endothelium (inner lining) of blood vessels use nitric oxide to signal the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, thus dilating the artery and increasing blood flow. This underlies the action of nitroglycerin, amyl nitrate, \"poppers\" (isobutyl nitrite or similar) and other nitrate derivatives in the treatment of heart disease: The compounds are converted to nitric oxide (by a process that is not completely understood), which in turn dilates the coronary artery (blood vessels around the heart), thereby increasing its blood supply. Nitric oxide also acts on cardiac muscle to decrease contractility and heart rate. The vasodilatory actions of nitric oxide play a key role in renal control of extracellular fluid homeostasis. Nitric oxide also plays a role in erection of the penis. Nitric oxide is also a second messenger in the nervous system and has been associated with neuronal activity and various functions like avoidance learning.\\nNitric oxide is synthesized by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). There are three isoforms of the NOS enzyme: endothelial (eNOS), neuronal (nNOS), and inducible (iNOS) - each with separate functions. The neuronal enzyme (NOS-1) and the endothelial isoform (NOS-3) are calcium-dependent and produce low levels of gas as a cell-signaling molecule. The inducible isoform (NOS-2) is calcium-independent and produces large amounts of gas which can be cytotoxic.\\nNitric Oxide (NO) is of critical importance as a mediator of vasorelaxation in blood vessels. Platelet-derived factors, shear stress, angiotensin II, acetylcholine, and cytokines stimulate the production of NO by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). eNOS synthesizes NO from the terminal guanidine-nitrogen of L-arginine and oxygen and yields citrulline as a byproduct. NO production by eNOS is dependent on calcium - calmodulin and other cofactors. NO, a highly reactive free radical then diffuses into the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessel and interacts with soluble guanylate cyclase. Nitric oxide stimulates the soluble guanylate cyclase to generate the second messenger cyclic GMP (3’,5’ guanosine monophosphate)from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The soluble cGMP activates cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase G (PKG or cGKI). PKG is a kinase that phosphorylates a number of proteins that regulate calcium concentrations, calcium sensitization, hyperpolarize cell through potassium channels, actin filament and myosin dynamic alterations that result in smooth muscle relaxation.(see smooth muscle article). .\\nAngiogenesis\\nThe underlying mechanisms behind angiogenesis are beginning to be discovered. The process may begin with vasodilatation mediated by nitric oxide followed by an increase in permeability mediated by VEGF. This increased permeability allows for plasma protein extravasation and scaffold formation. Endothelial cell migration is supported by adhesion molecules such as PECAM-1 and cadherins. The vascular smooth muscle cells detaching and loosening signaled by Ang2 enables the migration and sprouting of endothelial cells. The process of angiogenesis is initiated by VEGF by Ang1 and is required to stabilize the endothelial networks and to increase periendothelial cell interactions. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates inflammatory cells and promotes cell-cell interactions by molecules such as integrin. VEGF has morphogenic effects which allow endothelial cells cords to acquire and enlarge their lumen. Unfortunately, muscularization of the network is poorly understood. The process appears to be tissue-specific. In the coronary arteries, the epicardial layer appears to be the source of smooth muscle cells which migrate under PDGF-BB and VEGF stimulation. TGF-beta and downstream transcription factors Smads promote extracellular matrix production and solidify cell-cell interactions. FGF can help further this process resulting in arteriogenesis. In pathologic conditions such as ischemic myocardium, arteriogenesis can allow for as much as a 20-fold enlargement of collateral network vessels. Chemokines and cytokines are upregulated by increased collateral flow which results in monocyte recruitment. Monocytes produce proteinases which cause medial destruction and further remodeling. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF), and their stabilization by peptide regulator 39 help induce and potentiate the neovascularization process. Newer imaging techniques utilize knowledge of molecular mechanisms to help enhance image resolution and improve sensitivity and specificity.\\nPulmonary microvascular dilation and angiogenesis are two central pathogenic features that drive abnormal pulmonary gas exchange in experimental hepatopulmonary syndrome, and thus might underlie hepatopulmonary syndrome in humans.   \\n\\nVasodilators\\nThe exact pathogenesis of the hepatopulmonary syndrome is not completely understood.\\nIt is thought that hepatopulmonary syndrome is the result of microscopic intrapulmonary arteriovenous dilatations due to either increased liver production or decreased liver clearance of vasodilators, possibly involving nitric oxide. \\n   \\nThe progression to hepatopulmonary syndrome is believed that involves the nitric oxide metabolism. The dilation of these blood vessels causes overperfusion relative to ventilation, leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxemi a. There is an increased gradient between the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli of the lung and adjacent arteries (alveolar-arterial A-a gradient) while breathing room air. Patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome have platypnea - orthodeoxia syndrome (POS); that is, because intrapulmonary vascular dilations (IPVDs) predominate in the bases of the lungs, standing worsens hypoxemia (orthodeoxia)/dyspnea (platypnea) and the supine positio n improves oxygenation as blood is redistributed from the bases to the apices. Additionally, late in cirrhosis, it is common to develop high output failure, which would lead to less time in capillaries per red blood cell, exacerbating the hypoxemia.\\nAngiogenesis\\nAs discussed below a variety of angiogenesis-related genes polymorphism has been linked to hepatopulmonary syndrome. An increased levels of endothelin-1 in cirrhotic patients have been correlated with intrapulmonary molecular and gas exchange abnormalities, hypothesizing a probable contribution to the pathogenesis of hepatopulmonary syndrome.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'Could you provide me with the given sentence so I can rephrase it for you?', 'output': 'Marburg hemorrhagic fever must be differentiated from other viral hemorrhagic fevers that may cause fever, abdominal pain,and bleeding such as Ebola, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Hantavirus Infection, Rift Valley fever, Lujo hemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever.

If patients have audible bruits on exam or known significant carotid atherosclerosis, carotid sinus massage (CSM) is generally not recommended.\\nThe usual criteria for diagnosis are >3 seconds of ventricular asystole and/or a fall of SBP of >50 mmHg during carotid sinus massage.\\nThe massage is defined as firm steady pressure to the carotid sinus for ~5 seconds with the neck in the hyperextended position while supine. The carotid sinus can be found along the carotid artery medial to the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) at the level of the thyroid cartilage. Heart rate, blood pressure, EKG and clinical response are monitored for change. The procedure is then repeated on the other side. The procedure may be repeated standing to evaluate carotid sinus vasodepressor hypersensitivity.\\nPatients may have either a heart rate fall, the cardioinhibitory response, or fall in blood pressure, the vasodepressor response. Weiss and Baker also reported that some patients suffered from syncope without any fall in heart rate or blood pressure, they called the primary cerebral type. \\nThe test is not all-together sensitive or specific. If normal patients are tested, some will have a fall in blood pressure and heart rate despite no history of syncope. Other patients with history of syncope will have a fall in HR or BP but no reproducible symptoms at the time of the test.\\nMany patients will give a history of syncope or near-syncope with movement of the neck, wearing of a tight collar, shaving, etc. This history is not necessary, however, to make the diagnosis. Patients are usually upright, often standing, and develop a sudden episode of syncope, often with an associated fall. Small convulsive movements often occur with the loss of consciousness. The loss of consciousness is usually <30 seconds, and patients awake quickly with no clouding of consciousness.\\nThe syndrome has been described in patients in chronic Afib, in addition to patients in normal sinus rhythm (NSR).\\nPressing on the eyes can elicit a vagal response, but this is not part of the syndrome.\\nCaeful examination should be done to assess for carotid bruits and to assure that there is no obvious mass compressing the carotid (such as tumors or lymph nodes).'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'Could you provide me with the context of the sentence for me to rephrase properly?

One is a snail, the other is a bird or mammal. Schistosomes are gonochoristic and sexual reproduction takes place in the vertebrate host. In genera that infect birds, adult worms occur in tissues and veins of the host’s gastrointestinal tract, where they produce eggs that are shed into water with host feces. One European species, Trichobilharzia regenti, instead infects the bird host’s nasal tissues, where its eggs are shed with lachrymal secretions.\\nOnce a schistosome egg is immersed in water, a short-lived, non-feeding, free-living stage known as the miracidium emerges. The miracidium uses cilia to follow chemical and physical cues thought to increase its chances of finding the first intermediate host in its life cycle, a snail. After infecting a snail, it develops into a mother sporocyst, which in turn undergoes asexual reproduction, yielding large numbers of daughter sporocysts, which asexually produce another short-lived, free-living stage, the cercaria. Cercariae use a tail-like appendage (often forked in genera causing swimmer’s itch) to swim to the surface of the water, as well as other physical and chemical cues, in order to locate the next and final (definitive) host in the life cycle, a bird. After infecting a bird, the parasite develops into a schistosomulum and migrates through the host’s circulatory system (or nervous system in case of T. regenti) to the final location within the host body where it matures and, if it encounters a mate, sheds eggs to begin the cycle.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'Can you provide any information about Simvastatin?', 'output': 'Simvastatin comes as a tablet to take by mouth.

There may also be a direct contractile effect on vascular smooth muscle.\\nCocaine usage can also predispose to coronary thrombosis as a consequence of coronary spasm. Moreover, cocaine increases the response of platelets to arachidonic acid, thus increasing thromboxane A2 production and platelet aggregation and thus predisposing to cocaine related arterial thrombosis. Cocaine also causes sinus tachycardia, as well as an increase in blood pressure and myocardial contractility, thereby increasing myocardial oxygen demand. These increases can precipitate myocardial ischemia and UA / NSTEMI in both the presence and absence of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis and coronary spasm.\\nThe typical patient with cocaine related chest pain, unstable angina or MI is:\\nYoung (usually less than 40 yrs) Male gender Cigarette smoker Has symptom onset minutes or even several hours after cocaine use.\\nIt can occur with all routes of administration and with small or large doses.\\nTreatment includes nitroglycerin and calcium channel blockers. If patients have STEMI and show no response to sublingual NTG and calcium channel blockers, immediate coronary angiography should be performed, if possible. PCI has been successfully performed in these patients but can problematic in subjects with cocaine-related MI since those in whom stents are deployed are at substantial risk of subsequent in- stent thrombosis unless double-antiplatelet therapy (ASA and clopidogrel) is ingested regularly and predictably for several months afterward, and those who partake in substance abuse often are unreliable in adhering to such a regimen. Beta blockers should not be used in patients with cocaine induced MI as it can augment cocaine induced coronary arterial vasoconstriction. In order to control sinus tachycardia and hypertension (after initial NTG and calcium channel blockers), labetalol, an alpha blocker and beta blocker, has been advocated, because it has been shown not to induce coronary artery vasoconstriction.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is Carcinoma and what are the different types of lung carcinoma?', 'output': 'Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor originating in the epithelial cells of glandular tissue and forming glandular structures.

For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis,  a titer of antibodies directed against Epstein-Barr virus or Lyme disease is estimated from the blood. If those antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected, or the infection occurred a very long time ago, and the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed. In clinical immunology, levels of individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) to characterize the antibody profile of patient.  Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients whom the diagnosis is unclear.  For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis. Autoimmune disorders can often be traced to antibodies that bind the body\\'s own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test.  The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.  Practically, several immunodiagnostic methods based on detection of complex antigen-antibody are used to diagnose infectious diseases, for example ELISA, immunofluorescence, Western blot, immunodiffusion, and immunoelectrophoresis.\\n\"Targeted\" monoclonal antibody therapy is employed to treat diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,  multiple sclerosis,  psoriasis,  and many forms of cancer including non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma,  colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and breast cancer.  Some immune deficiencies, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, result in partial or complete lack of antibodies.  These diseases are often treated by inducing a short term form of immunity called passive immunity. Passive immunity is achieved through the transfer of ready-made antibodies in the form of human or animal serum, pooled immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies, into the affected individual. \\nRho(D) Immune Globulin antibodies are specific for human Rhesus D antigen, also known as Rhesus factor.  These antibodies are known under several brand names, including RhoGAM. Rhesus factor is an antigen found on red blood cells; individuals that are Rhesus-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rhesus-negative (Rh-) do not. During normal childbirth, delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a fetus can enter the mother\\'s system. In the case of an Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the pregnancy, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn.  RhoGAM is administered as part of a prenatal treatment regimen to prevent sensitization that may occur when a Rhesus-negative mother has a Rhesus-positive fetus. Treatment of a mother with RhoGAM antibodies prior to and immediately after trauma and delivery destroys Rh antigen in the mother\\'s system from the fetus. Importantly, this occurs before the antigen can stimulate maternal B cells to \"remember\" Rh antigen by generating memory B cells. Therefore, her humoral immune system will not make anti-Rh antibodies, and will not attack the Rhesus antigens of the current or subsequent baby. RhoGAM treatment prevents sensitization that can lead to Rh disease, but does not prevent or treat the underlying disease itself.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What are the other diagnostic tests for hand-foot-and-mouth disease?', 'output': 'Hand foot mouth disease is a clinical diagnosis, there is no need for performing diagnostic tests.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is the meaning of clitoromegaly and what are the factors that lead to it?', 'output': 'Clitoromegaly is otherwise a rare condition and can be either present by birth or acquired later in life.

A small number of wounds that do not fall into these categories may be due to causes such as radiation poisoning or ischemia. \\nVenous ulcers, which usually occur in the legs, account for about 70% to 90% of chronic wounds  and mostly affect the elderly. They are thought to be due to venous hypertension caused by improper function of valves that exist in the veins to prevent blood from flowing backward. Ischemia results from the dysfunction and, combined with reperfusion injury, causes the tissue damage that leads to the wounds.\\nAnother major cause of chronic wounds, diabetes, is increasing in prevalence.  Diabetics have a 15% higher risk for amputation than the general population  due to chronic ulcers. Diabetes causes neuropathy, which inhibits the perception of pain.  Thus patients may not initially notice small wounds to legs and feet, and may therefore fail to prevent infection or repeated injury.  Further, diabetes causes immune compromise and damage to small blood vessels, preventing adequate oxygenation of tissue, which can cause chronic wounds.  Pressure also plays a role in the formation of diabetic ulcers. \\nAnother leading type of chronic wounds is pressure ulcers,  which usually occur in people with conditions such as paralysis that inhibit movement of body parts that are commonly subjected to pressure such as the heels, shoulder blades, and sacrum.   Pressure ulcers are caused by ischemia that occurs when pressure on the tissue is greater than the pressure in capillaries, and thus restricts blood flow into the area.  Muscle tissue, which needs more oxygen and nutrients than skin does, shows the worst effects from prolonged pressure.

The heart and vessels are accessed via median sternotomy. The heart/lung machine (cardiopulmonary bypass machine) is connected. Since, the heart/lung machine needs its \"circulation\" to be filled with blood, a child will require a blood transfusion for this surgery. The patient is cooled for 20 minutes to 20 Celsius degree rectal temperature. Once the heart is stopped and emptied, the aorta and the pulmonary artery are divided. The site of the aortic transection is marked before the cross clamp is applied. The aorta and pulmonary artery are transected at a level above the valve sinuses. The ostium of the coronary arteries are excised along with a large segment of surrounding aortic wall and sutured into place in the neo-aorta (basal part of the pulmonary artery). The pulmonary trunk is moved forward into its new position anterior to the aorta. Finally, the switched great arteries are sutured into place. The heart is then allowed to fill and take over its normal function. Temporary pacemaker wires and drainage tubes are then placed and the chest is closed. Some arterial switch recipients may present with post-operative pulmonary stenosis, which would then be repaired with angioplasty, pulmonary stenting via heart cath or median sternotomy, and/or xenograft. Lecompte maneuver - During this surgery the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries are placed anterior to the aorta.

These patients usually go to the intensive care unit after surgery.\\nSometimes when the brain is injured swelling occurs and fluids accumulate within the brain space. When an injury occurs inside the skull-encased brain, there is no place for swollen tissues to expand and no adjoining tissues to absorb excess fluid. This leads to an increase in the pressure within the skull, called intracranial pressure (ICP). High ICP can cause delicate brain tissue to be crushed, or parts of the brain to herniate across structures within the skull, potentially leading to severe damage. Medical personnel measure a patient's ICP using a probe or catheter. The instrument is inserted through the skull to the subarachnoid level and is connected to a monitor that registers ICP. If a patient has high ICP, he or she may undergo a ventriculostomy, a procedure that drains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ventricles to bring the pressure down by way of an external ventricular drain.\\nDecompressive craniectomy is a last-resort surgical procedure in which part of the skull is removed in an attempt to reduce severely high ICP.\"}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': \"What exactly is Zenker's diverticulum?\", 'output': \"Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) also known as pharyngosophageal diverticulum.

Note that when mitral valve surgery is indicated, mitral valve repair is preferred over mitral valve replacement whenever feasible. \\nAbbreviations: MR: mitral regurgitation\\nMitral regurgitation is a syndrome of pure volume overload whereas aortic regurgitation is a combination of both volume and pressure overload. Both syndromes are associated with an increase in preload. In mitral regurgitation, the afterload is reduced whereas in aortic regurgitation the afterload is increased. This is very important because when the mitral valve is repaired, there is no longer a reduction afterload and the left ventricle may fail due to an abrupt rise in the afterload. In aortic regurgitation, because the afterload is already increased chronically, replacement of the valve is not as likely to precipitate acute left ventricular failure due to an abrupt rise in afterload. By the time symptoms develop, there is already left ventricular dysfunction. Because of the low pressure system into which the blood is ejected into through the mitral valve, the ejection fraction is always high in mitral regurgitation. If the ejection fraction appears to be \"normal\", there is already decline in left ventricular function. There is no indication for vasodilator therapy in the absence of systemic hypertension in asymptomatic patients with preserved left ventricular function.\\nThere are two surgical options for the treatment of mitral regurgitation: mitral valve replacement and mitral valve repair. In general, mitral valve repair is preferred to mitral valve replacement as it carries a lower risk of subsequent prosthetic valve endocarditis and results in better preservation of left ventricular function.\\nThe ACC/AHA 2008 guidelines  recommend mitral valve repair rather than mitral valve replacement if the anatomy is appropriate, including patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease  and mitral valve prolapse  (Grade 1C).

Revascularization is a treatment of choice for myocardial ischemia. Survival after CABG in patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia was reasonable. For patients with ischemic heart disease and reduced LVEF undergoing CABG, the risk of sudden cardiac death lessened compared with medical therapy. Among survival of SCD, the risk of death reduced by revascularization procedure including PCI or CABG. Ischemic heart disease is responsible for 24% to 55% of SCD cases in young patients <35 years of age. Anomalous aortic origin of the coronary arteries detected in 10% to 17% of patients in postmortem studies, is an important cause of SCD in the young. Revascularization is recommended for treating ischemia leading life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia due to anomalous aortic origin of the coronary arteries. Cardiac surgery is rarely performed for treating ventricular tachycardia in case of highly symptomatic patients with failed antiarrhythmic medications or unsuccessful ventricular ablation. Inaccessible sites for ventricular ablation including area deep in the myocardium, beneath epicardial fat, or near the coronary arteries may lead to unsuccessful ablation. Surgical ablation of ventricular arrhythmia can be done during other surgical intervention such as placement of LVAD or at the time of left ventricular aneurysectomy which is a substrate for VT. VT or VF maybe provoked by Sympathetic activation and maybe inhibited by parasympathetic activity. Prevention of ventricular arrhythmia can be done by interruption of sympathetic outflow to the heart, pharmacological beta-blockade, or through stimulation of the parasympathetic pathway (vagal nerve stimulators, spinal cord stimulators).

Among them are: Culex (C. annulirostris, C. bitaeniorhynchus, C. quinquefasciatus, and C. pipiens); Anopheles (A. arabinensis, A. bancroftii, A. farauti, A. funestus, A. gambiae, A. koliensis, A. melas, A. merus, A. punctulatus and A. wellcomei); Aedes (A. aegypti, A. aquasalis, A. bellator, A. cooki, A. darlingi, A. kochi, A. polynesiensis, A. pseudoscutellaris, A. rotumae, A. scapularis, and A. vigilax); Mansonia (M. pseudotitillans, M. uniformis); Coquillettidia (C. juxtamansonia). During a blood meal, an infected mosquito introduces third-stage filarial larvae onto the skin of the human host, where they penetrate into the bite wound (1). They develop in adults that commonly reside in the lymphatics (2). The female worms measure 80 to 100 mm in length and 0.24 to 0.30 mm in diameter, while the males measure about 40 mm by.1 mm. Adults produce microfilariae measuring 244 to 296 μm by 7.5 to 10 μm, which are sheathed and have nocturnal periodicity, except the South Pacific microfilariae which have the absence of marked periodicity. The microfilariae migrate into lymph and blood channels moving actively through lymph and blood (3). A mosquito ingests the microfilariae during a blood meal (4). After ingestion, the microfilariae lose their sheaths and some of them work their way through the wall of the proventriculus and cardiac portion of the mosquito's midgut and reach the thoracic muscles (5). There the microfilariae develop into first-stage larvae (6) and subsequently into third-stage infective larvae (7). The third-stage infective larvae migrate through the hemocoel to the mosquito's prosbocis (8) and can infect another human when the mosquito takes a blood meal (1).\\nThe typical vector for Brugia malayi filariasis are mosquito species from the genera Mansonia and Aedes. During a blood meal, an infected mosquito introduces third-stage filarial larvae onto the skin of the human host, where they penetrate into the bite wound (1). They develop into adults that commonly reside in the lymphatics (2). The adult worms resemble those of Wuchereria bancrofti but are smaller. Female worms measure 43 to 55 mm in length by 130 to 170 μm in width, and males measure 13 to 23 mm in length by 70 to 80 μm in width. Adults produce microfilariae, measuring 177 to 230 μm in length and 5 to 7 μm in width, which are sheathed and have nocturnal periodicity. The microfilariae migrate into lymph and enter the blood stream reaching the peripheral blood (3). A mosquito ingests the microfilariae during a blood meal (4). After ingestion, the microfilariae lose their sheaths and work their way through the wall of the proventriculus and cardiac portion of the midgut to reach the thoracic muscles (5).

Freckling can also be triggered by long exposure to sunlight, such as suntanning. When the sun’s rays penetrate the skin, they activate melanocytes which can cause freckles to become darker and more numerous, although the distribution of melanin is not the same. Fair hair such as blonde, or more commonly red hair, are usually common with the genetic factor of freckles, but none so much as fair or pale skin.\\nFreckles are predominantly found on the face, although they may appear on any skin exposed to the sun. Freckles are rare on infants, and more common on children before puberty; they are less common on adults.\\nChildren who do not produce enough melanin to protect their skin against harmful rays from the sun develop temporary freckles associated with childhood that usually go away upon puberty, once more melanin is produced. People with the fairest skin often do not produce enough melanin, and so freckles are present after puberty and into adulthood, indicating that individual as a genetic carrier for freckles.\\nUpon exposure to the sun, freckles will reappear if they have been altered with creams or lasers and not protected from the sun, but do however fade with age in some cases. Freckles are not a skin disorder. People with a predisposition to freckles may be especially susceptible to sunburn and skin cancer, and should therefore take extra care to protect themselves in the sun with a daily sunblock of at least 15 SPF.\\nDuring the Middle Ages and up until the early 15th century in Europe, an excess of freckles (\"witchmarks\" or \"witchspots\") became associated with witchcraft and witche, most likely because of genetic pairing with red hair, also considered to be a quality of witches. \\nEphelides is a genetic trait.

Meigs syndrome was first discovered by Otto von Spiegelberg, a German gynecologist, in 1866. There is no classification system established for Meigs syndrome. Other variants of Meigs syndrome include pseudo-meigs syndrome, and atypical Meigs\\' syndrome. Meigs syndrome may be caused by either ovarian fibroma, Brenner tumor, ovarian thecoma, or granulosa cell tumor. The pathogenesis of Meigs syndrome is characterized by a transudative process. The prevalence of benign ovarian tumors is approximately 2-10%, and only 1-2% develop Meigs syndrome. Meigs syndrome is more commonly observed among postmenopausal women. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 50 years. The majority of patients with Meigs syndrome are asymptomatic. Early clinical features include bloating, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Computed tomography is the imaging modality of choice for Meigs syndrome. On conventional radiography, Meigs syndrome is characterized by blunting of the costophrenic angle or fluid within the horizontal or oblique fissures (250-600 ml of fluid is required before the pleural effusion becomes evident). Surgery is the mainstay of therapy for Meigs syndrome. Exploratory laparotomy with surgical staging is the most common approach to the treatment of Meigs syndrome. Once diagnosed and successfully treated, patients with Meigs syndrome are followed-up every 6 months. Follow-up testing includes; serum cancer antigen 125, ultrasound, and basic metabolic profile.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What other diagnostic tests are used for neurofibroma?', 'output': 'There are no other diagnostic study findings associated with neurofibroma.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is an overview of Uveitis?', 'output': 'Uveitis specifically refers to inflammation of the middle layer of the eye, termed the \" uvea \". In common usage, it may refer to an inflammatory process involving the interior of the eye. The uvea consists of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid; it provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis may occur unilaterally or bilaterally, affect the anterior, intermediate, or posterior segment of the eye, may be infectious or non infectious, and granulomatous or non-granulomatous. The exact pathogenesis of uveitis is not fully understood. It is thought that uveitis is mediated by a genetic predisposition and an acquired cross immunity to infectious agents, or cross immunity to self-antigens due to underlying autoimmune diseases. Common causes of uveitis include seronegative spondyloarthropathy, sarcoidosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet syndrome, multiple sclerosis, AIDS, syphilis, and tuberculosis. Uveitis must be differentiated from other diseases such as conjunctivitis, endophthalmitis, or scleritis. A history of cigarette smoking is associated with all etiologies and subtypes of uveitis. Uveitis is estimated to be responsible for approximately 10% of the blindness in the United States. If left untreated uveitis can progress to permanent vision loss or result in complications such as cataracts, glaucoma, and retinal detachment. A history of an underlying associated condition along with symptoms of eye pain, redness, photophobia, floaters, and blurry vision is strongly suggestive of uveitis. There are no specific laboratory or physical examination findings associated with uveitis. Imaging modalities may assist in diagnosing an underlying condition, though have no diagnostic utility for uveitis itself. Slit lamp test is the diagnostic modality of choice. Other ophthalmologic studies may assist in further characterizing the disease. Mainstay medical therapy is by high dose corticosteroids. Targeted antimicrobials may be required to treat an underlying infection. Surgical intervention is reserved for managing complications of uveitis such as cataract surgery or glaucoma surgery. The only indicated guideline for screening is in patients suspected of or diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Prompt treatment of a potential underlying infection may help prevent development of uveitis.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is the medical treatment for Goodpasture syndrome?', 'output': 'Currently there is no cure for Goodpasture syndrome.

Surgery is best reserved for patients with small tumors located in the sinonasal cavity without involvement of the orbit or skull base. For more advanced tumors, the successful treatment includes surgery and radiation therapy with most of the institutions favoring delivery of postoperative, rather than preoperative, radiotherapy. Large and bulky tumors (T3 and T4) are treated with preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by surgery. The optimal treatment of esthesioneuroblastoma includes complete surgical resection of the tumor followed by radiation therapy. However, some institutions have reported success with alternative treatment modalities, including surgery without radiation.\\nDulguerov’s 2001 meta-analysis showed lower recurrence rates for the combination of surgery and radiotherapy. The literature gives little support to single-modality treatments; only few studies have advocated either radiation or surgery alone.  Some institutions advocate surgery alone for Kadish stage A tumors, whereas the majority suggest adjuvant radiotherapy for these lesions.\\nThe traditional surgical approach for esthesioneuroblastoma, is craniofacial resection (CFR). Craniofacial resection is a combined transcranial and transfacial approach, which includes a lateral rhinotomy or midfacial degloving and frontal craniotomy. The objective of this approach is to achieve an en bloc resection of tumor and involved structures. It also involves removal of the olfactory bulbs, cribriform plate, roof of the ethmoid sinuses, upper septum, medial maxillae, and as much of the anterior cranial fossa dura as necessary. The advent of craniofacial resection is credited with increase in overall survival for esthesioneuroblastoma patients. The postoperative morbidity (approximately 35%) and mortality (2-5%) with craniofacial resection is relatively high, although the complication rate associated with craniofacial resection has decreased over the last few decades.\\nAlthough traditional craniofacial resection remains the gold standard, less invasive endoscopic techniques have become increasingly utilized. Minimally invasive endoscopic resection (MIER) is a complete endoscopic approach, most suited for tumors that have not invaded the brain tissue. Endoscopic-assisted cranionasal resection (EA-CNR) combines transnasal endoscopic approach with craniotomy and addresses large tumors that have invaded brain tissue. There are distinct advantages of EA-CNR and MIER over traditional CFR. Endoscopic techniques allow great access to anatomic areas where external approaches are notoriously known to fail, such as frontal recess and the sphenoid sinus region. The endoscope plays an important role in tumor surveillance, in the postoperative period. Finally, the endoscopic approach eliminates the need for disfiguring facial incisions. Endoscopic techniques have shown to have comparable success rates but fewer complications compared with traditional craniofacial resection.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is transferrinemia and what are the treatments for it?', 'output': 'Treatment with infusions of plasma or purified apotransferrin may stabilise or correct the anemia and growth defects.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is the Ansa cervicalis?', 'output': 'Two roots make up the ansa cervicalis.\\nThe superior root (descendens hypoglossi) of the ansa cervicalis is formed by a branch of spinal nerve C1.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict who will reinfarct following fibrinolytic therapy. Among patients undergoing primary PCI, bivalirudin monotherapy has been associated with stent thrombosis in the HORIZONS-AMI and EUROMAX trials.   Aggressive antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy minimizes the risk of reinfarction.\\nA new murmur in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction should raise an immediate concern of mechanical complicaitons such as papillary muscle rupture, septal rupture, and free-wall rupture which portend a dismal prognosis and may be differentiated on the basis of physical and echocardiographic findings or hemodynamic profiles. Other mechanical sequelae include true or false ventricular aneurysm, dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure.\\nA true left ventricular aneurysm is an outpouching formed by a stretched, thinned-out myocardial scar. Patients with transmural infarction and patients who do not receive reperfusion therapy are at increased risk. LV aneurysm may manifest acutely as low-output cardiogenic shock or chronically as heart failure or thromboembolism in the presence of mural thrombus. A large, diffuse point of maximal impulse and S 3 gallops may be evident on physical examination. A chest radiograph may demonstrate a localized bulging segment in the cardiac silhouette. Dyskinetic or paradoxical motions of the aneurysmal segment may be detected by echocardiography or ventriculography. True aneurysm connects with the LV cavity by a wide neck and is less susceptible to rupture than a false aneurysm. ACE inhibitor and vasodilator are used in the mangement of chronic heart failure associated with ventricular aneurysm. Anticoagulant is indicated in the presence of mural thrombus. Sustained ventricular arrhythmia from an aneurysm may require defibrillator placement. Surgical resection may be considered in selected cases with refractory symptoms.\\nIn contrast to the true aneurysm which contains viable myocardium in its wall, pseudoaneurysm lacks the myocardial elements and is formed by adherent pericardium and organized hematoma. Unlike true ventricular aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm communicates with the cavity of the left ventricle through a narrow neck and is more prone to rupture. Pseudoaneurysm may partially reduce stroke volume similar to a true aneurysm. Surgery is recommended for all patients regardless of symptoms or the size of pseudoaneurysm in light of a high risk for spontaneous rupture and sudden death.\\nPapillary muscle rupture is characterized by symptoms of acute severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary edema and should be suspected in STEMI patients with a new soft holosystolic murmur at the apex. Posterior papillary muscle rupture, as occurs in inferior MI, is more common than anterior papillary muscle rupture which may be a complication of anterior or lateral MI. Posterior papillary muscle is considered more susceptible to ischemic rupture due to its singular blood supply from the posterior descending artery. In contradistinction to the posterior papillary muscle, the anterior papillary muscle receives a dual blood supply from the left anterior descending artery and the circumflex artery.  Urgent transthoracic echocardiography should be obtained to establish a definite diagnosis. Nitroglycerin or nitroprusside may be used to temporize the patient if systolic blood pressure is above 90 mm Hg. If the patient cannot tolerate vasodilator due to rapid hemodynamic deterioration, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be instituted as a bridging therapy until emergency mitral valve replacement can be performed.\\nPatients with septal rupture frequently report chest pain, shortness of breath, and symptoms of low-output cardiogenic shock. Key physical findings include a harsh, loud holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border, palpable thrill at the right precordium, S 3 gallops, and accentuation of pulmonic component of the second heart sound. Color Doppler echocardiography is useful for determining the location and size of the defect and detecting left-to-right shunt and right ventricular overload. Septal rupture should be managed by temporary stabilization with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation followed by intravenous vasodilator and early surgical closure.\\nFree-wall rupture usually leads to hemopericardium and abrupt circulatory collapse. Clinical manifestations range from anginal, pleuritic, or pericardial chest discomfort to catastrophic symptoms of cardiogenic shock, cardiac tamponade, and sudden death. Echocardiography is useful for the diagnosis and emergency pericardiocentesis may be indicated for cardiac tamponade.

Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What other imaging findings are associated with hyperparathyroidism?', 'output': 'Other imaging modalities are used for preoperative localization of hyper-functioning parathyroid glands. This includes both non-invasive and invasive modalities. Another modality used in hyperparathyroidism is dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). DXA is helpful in detecting low bone mineral density (BMD) caused by hyperparathyroidism.\\nTechnetium-99m -methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-sestamibi or MIBI) scintigraphy is the most popular investigation for preoperative localization of hyper-functioning parathyroid glands.  Most of the sestamibi is retained in mitochondria of thyroid and abnormal parathyroid tissue and is a function of mitochondrial activity.  Single-isotope, double-phase technique is used. The basis of \"single-isotope, double-phase technique\" is that sestamibi washes out of the thyroid more rapidly than from abnormal parathyroid tissue.  Multiple planar images are obtained, typically one shortly after injection of 99mTc-sestamibi and another after two hours to identify the areas of retained sestamibi showing hyper-functioning parathyroid tissue. As all parathyroid lesions does not retain sestamibi nor all thyroid tissue washes out quickly, subtraction imaging may be beneficial.  Subtraction technique uses dual contrast Tc-99m sestamibi along with iodine-123 or 99m-technicium pertechnetate, which are taken by thyroid tissue only. Iodine-123/99m-technicium pertechnetate images of thyroid are later digitally subtracted from Tc-99m sestamibi images leading to visualization of parathyroid tissue only.  Presence of solid thyroid nodule is the most common cause of false positive results. Other causes of false positive results may include thyroid carcinoma, lymphoma, and lymphadenopathy. The sensitivity of sestamibi scintigraphy can be increased by using it concomitantly with neck ultrasound and/or SPECT.   The sensitivity of sestamibi scintigraphy is 80% - 90%.   \\nFactors influencing sensitivity of Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy Factors Sensitivity Biochemical factors High serum calcium level  Increased High serum parathyroid hormone level   Increased Hypovitaminosis D  (only in primary hyperparathyroidism) Increased Calcium channel blocker use  (only in primary hyperparathyroidism) Decreased Gross and architectural factors Size (Large)   Increased Multi-glandular disease  Decreased Cytological factors Increased amount of cellular content   (Chief cells and oxyphil cells) Increased Immunohistochemical factors Increased P-glycoprotien expression  Decreased Note: P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is a plasma membrane protein encoded by mammalian multidrug resistance gene (MDRI). Many drugs that are lipophilic and cationic at physiological pH interact with P-gp. Sestamibi is a lipophilic cationic on physioligical pH. P-gp acts as ATP-dependent efflux pump and prevents accumulation of sestamibi in parathyroid tissue. So, the uptake of sestamibi into parathyroid adenoma cells depends on the activity of the P-gp .\\nSingle photon emission computed tomography may be used along with Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy for preoperative evaluation of hyper-functioning parathyroid gland.   Sestamibi-SPECT is also called pinhone-SPECT (P-SPECT). P-SPECT uses cone beam collimator in contrast to parallel-hole collimator used in SPECT. cone bean collimator possess more suitable geometric properties leading to high spatial resolution.   Using SPECT with sestamibi scintigraphy improves detection and localization of hyper-functioning parathyroid gland.   P-SPECT provides more precise result of sestamibi scitigraphy allowing surgeon to choose best route for surgical intervention. P-SPECT may detect glands not visible on planer images leading to increased sensitivity. It is very useful in case of uncertain result from conventional sestamibi scitigraphy.   P-SPECT also enables accurate interpretation sestamibi uptake in upper mediastinum leading to a higher specificity. In difficult cases, P-SPECT may also be adjuncted with subtraction Tc-99m sestamibi and I-123 scintigraphy or positron emission tomography.  P-SPECT is approximately 84% sensitive, 91% specific with positive predictive value of around 91% and negative predictive value of around 84%.  Fusion images of CT-MIBI-SPECT is superior to CT scan or MIBI-SPECT alone in preoperative localization of hyper-functioning parathyroid gland. \\n11C-methionine PET along with CT scan (MET-PET/CT) may be used for preoperative localization of hyper-functioning parathyroid glands.   MET-PET/CT may be used as an complimentary imaging modality for localizing hyper-functioning parathyroid glands in patients with negative Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy / SPECT results. \\nSelective transarterial hypocalcemic stimulation is combined with nonselective venous sampling to perform selective arteriography.  Sodium citrate is injected to induce hypocalcemia. Simultaneous arteriography is performed. Samples are taken for superior vena cava at basaeline and timed intervals (20 sec, 40 sec, and 60 sec). An increase in the parathyroid hormone level to 1.4 times above the baseline or a clear blush observed on arteriography is considered as positive localization. Arterial stimulation venous sampling is performed simultaneously with arteriogram due to similarly high PPV.\\nSuperselective arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and superselective conventional angiography (CA) may be used for preoperative localization of hyper-functioning parathyroid glands in which noninvasive imaging modalities are negative or inconclusive.  Sensitivity of superselective digital subtraction angiography appears to be similar to conventional angiography. Superselective arterial digital subtraction angiography may be more sensitive than conventional angiography for preoperative localization of mediastinal hyper-functioning parathyroid glands.\\nLow bone mineral density (BMD) is caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. Distal forearm is affected most commonly. DXA of distal forearm should be done in all patients of primary hyperparathyroidism. Very low T-score of distal forearm is observed in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is the natural progression of Alstrom syndrome, its associated complications, and what is the expected prognosis?', 'output': 'Blindness Hearing loss Congestive heart failure Cirrhosis Pancreatitis ESRD Hypothyroidism Pulmonary fibrosis Portal hypertension Type 2 diabetes mellitus Stunted growth'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What is the definition of Clitoromegaly and how is it diagnosed?', 'output': 'In the most pronounced cases, clitoromegaly is a symptom of intersexuality since the large clitoris resembles a penis (the different grade of genital ambiguity is commonly measured by the Prader classification  ranging, in ascending order of masculinisation, from 1: Female external genitalia with clitoromegaly through 5: Pseudo-Phallus looking like normal male external genitalia ).'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What does the term \"thyroid\" refer to?', 'output': \"Hypothyroidism (underactivity) Hashimoto's thyroiditis / thyroiditis Ord's thyroiditis Postoperative hypothyroidism Postpartum thyroiditis Silent thyroiditis Acute thyroiditis Iatrogenic hypothyroidism Hyperthyroidism (overactivity) Thyroid storm Graves-Basedow disease Toxic thyroid nodule Toxic nodular struma (Plummer's disease) Hashitoxicosis Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism De Quervain thyroiditis (inflammation starting as hyperthyroidism, can end as hypothyroidism)\\nGoitre Endemic goitre Diffuse goitre Multinodular goitre Lingual thyroid Thyroglossal duct cyst\\nThyroid adenoma Thyroid cancer Papillary Follicular Medullary Anaplastic Lymphomas and metastasis from elsewhere (rare)\\nCretinism\\nMedication linked to thyroid disease includes amiodarone, lithium salts, some types of interferon and IL-2.\"}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What are the factors that put someone at risk for silent thyroiditis?', 'output': \"Common risk factors in the development of silent thyroiditis include lithium, radiation therapy in Hodgkin's lymphoma, cessation of corticosteroid s in Cushing's syndrome (post adrenalectomy), and certain autoimmune conditions.     \\nCommon risk factors in the development of silent thyroiditis include:\\nLithium Radiation therapy in Hodgkin's lymphoma Cessation of corticosteroids in Cushing's syndrome (post adrenalectomy)\\nLess common risk factors in the development of silent thyroiditis include:\\nSLE Immune thrombocytopenic purpura Lymphocytic hypophysitis\"}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': \"What exactly is Asperger's syndrome?\", 'output': 'Screening instruments for Asperger Syndrome include: Autism Screening Questionnaire (ASQ), Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Autism Spectrum Screening uestionnaire (ASSQ) and diagnostic instruments for Asperger Syndrome include: Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale (ASDS), Gilliam Asperger’s Disorder Scale (GADS) and Asperger Syndrome (and high-functioning autism) Diagnostic Interview (ASDI).'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'To what anomaly is Uhl referring?', 'output': 'Uhl anomaly is a very rare congenital heart disease with a partial or total loss of the myocardial muscle in the right ventricle.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What exactly is an endocardial cushion defect?', 'output': 'Based on the anatomical features and their impact on physiology, endocardial cushion defect may be classified into complete, partial, intermediate, transitional, and intermediate forms.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What does the term \"hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\" mean?', 'output': 'HSCT is associated with a high treatment-related mortality in the recipient (10% or higher), which limits its use to conditions that are themselves life-threatening. Major complications are veno-occlusive disease, mucositis, infections (sepsis) and graft-versus-host disease.\\nBone marrow transplantation usually requires that the recipient\\'s own bone marrow is destroyed (\"myeloablation\"). Prior to \"engraftment\" patients may go for several weeks without appreciable numbers of white blood cells to help fight infection. This puts a patient at high risk of infections, sepsis and septic shock, despite prophylactic antibiotics, and accounts for a large share of treatment-related mortality. The immunosuppressive agents employed in allogeneic transplants for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease further increase the risk of opportunistic infection. Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Transplant patients lose their acquired immunity, for example immunity to childhood diseases such as measles or polio. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood vaccines once they are off of immunosuppressive medications.\\nSevere liver injury is termed hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Elevated levels of bilirubin, hepatomegaly and fluid retention are clinical hallmarks of this condition. There is now a greater appreciation of the generalized cellular injury and obstruction in hepatic vein sinuses, and it has thus been referred to as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). Severe cases are associated with a high mortality. Anticoagulants or defibrotide may be effective in reducing the severity of VOD but may also increase bleeding complications. Ursodiol has been shown to help prevent VOD, presumably by helping the flow of bile.\\nThe injury of the mucosal lining of the mouth and throat and is a common regimen-related toxicity following ablative HSCT regimens. It is usually not life-threatening but is very painful, and prevents eating and drinking. Mucositis is treated with pain medications plus intravenous infusions to prevent dehydration and malnutrition.\\nGVHD is an inflammatory disease that is unique to allogeneic transplantation. It is an attack of the \"new\" bone marrow\\'s immune cells against the recipient\\'s tissues. This can occur even if the donor and recipient are HLA-identical because the immune system can still recognize other differences between their tissues. It is aptly named graft-versus-host disease because bone marrow transplantation is the only transplant procedure in which the transplanted cells must accept the body rather than the body accepting the new cells. Acute graft-versus-host disease typically occurs in the first 3 months after transplantation and may involve the skin, intestine, or the liver, and is often fatal. High-dose corticosteroids such as prednisone are a standard treatment; however this immuno-suppressive treatment often leads to deadly infections. Chronic graft-versus-host disease may also develop after allogeneic transplant. It is the major source of late treatment-related complications, although it less often results in death. In addition to inflammation, chronic graft-versus-host disease may lead to the development of fibrosis, or scar tissue, similar to scleroderma; it may cause functional disablity and require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy. Graft-versus-host disease is usually mediated by T cells when they react to foreign peptides presented on the MHC of the host.\\nThe beneficial aspect of the Graft-versus-Host phenomenon is known as the \"graft versus tumor\" or \"graft versus leukemia\" effect. For example, HCST patients with either acute and in particular chronic graft-versus-host disease after an allogeneic transplant tend to have a lower risk of cancer relapse  . This is due to a therapeutic immune reaction of the grafted donor lymphocytes, more specifically, the Natural Killer cells, against the diseased bone marrow of the recipient. This lower rate of relapse accounts for the increased success rate of allogeneic transplants compared to transplants from identical twins, and indicates that allogeneic HSCT is a form of immunotherapy. GVT is the major benefit of transplants which do not employ the highest immuno-suppressive regimens.'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'What does the curriculum for cardiac imaging entail?', 'output': 'Risk factors, primary prevention and screening Inducible myocardial ischemia Acute MI Chronic MI Post-MI complications Cardiac rupture LV aneurysm Papillary muscle rupture Congestive heart failure Dressler’s syndrome Myocardial viability Stunned myocardium Hibernating myocardium Therapeutic and interventional options'}, {'instruction': 'Answer this question truthfully', 'input': 'Can you provide an explanation of Dyspareunia, including its natural history, complications, and prognosis?', 'output': \"The symptom of dyspareunia is pain during intercourse/penetration, which could be either introital (at the vaginal entrance), deep (in the vagina or pelvis), or both.
